Bot Saber is a discord bot handy for anyone wanting to spice up their discord server with Beat Saber features and commands. It offers a great way to integrate the game right into your server. The bot boasts a list of various commands and features. We plan to expand these commands and consistently add more. For example, there's a BeatSaver integration and a ScoreSaber integration, allowing for beatmap searches and profile viewing from within Discord.
